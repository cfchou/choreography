# 1. For each launcher, 'plugin' and 'name' is required by the framework.
# 2. 'companions' are usually required unless the launcher such as IdleLauncher
#    doesn't need it.
# 3. 'args' are the plugin's parameters.
# 4. 'companions' contains a list of companion profiles and their names and
#     weights. It's strongly advised to inline companions by achors instead of
#     explicitly writing ones.
# 5. 'name' must be unique across the whole file.
